        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          This article compares two different design proposals for the expansion of Gatwick airport. The first expansion
          proposal is the construction of a completely new runway to the south of the existing runway. The second
          expansion proposal is the realignment of an existing inoperative runway (which is to the north of the existing
          runway). Ultimately while each expansion proposal will lead to two active runways at Gatwick, they achieve this
          in different ways. This articles evaluation of the engineering challenges and sustainability concerns of each
          geotechnical design found that the proposal that aligns most with civil engineering principles is the second
          proposal (the realignment of an existing inoperative runway).
        </p>
      </section>

      
      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Given the growing demand for air transportation, existing airport infrastructure can no longer safely meet the
          needs of both local and global communities. As a result, an expansion of airport infrastructure around London is
          necessary to increase capacity and meet growing demand. Gatwick offers a low impact solution to this issue, due
          to its unique existing infrastructure and location that can support expansion. <a href="#ref-irvine-2015">(Irvine, Budd and Pitfield, 2015)</a>
        </p>
      </section>

      
      <section id="proposal1">
        <h2>Proposal 1: Construction of a new runway to the south</h2>
        <p>
          Although Gatwick is the world's busiest single runway airport <a href="#ref-gatwick-2021">(Gatwick Airport Ltd, 2021)</a> (and this design
          would allow for more annual air transport movements than the second design), it introduces many civil
          engineering challenges. For example, due to the large land acquisition needed, the existing ecosystem will be
          significantly disturbed due to the loss of local greenfield sites. <a href="#ref-airports-commission-2014">(The Airports Commission, 2014)</a> Importantly,
          Gatwick's existing runway is built over the river Mole <a href="#ref-airports-commission-2014">(The Airports Commission, 2014)</a> which means that a new
          runway beyond the airport boundary would require diverting the river around the new airport perimeter before
          runway construction could start, therefore this proposal isn't just about building a new runway, it’s also
          rebuilding the local environment to make room for the new runway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, this development comes with significant geotechnical challenges due to the nature of the
          existing Weald clay soil which is poorly drained <a href="#ref-bgs-2023">(British Geological Survey, 2023)</a> and may cause water
          retention therefore raising concerns about ground stability which may result in uneven runway surfaces and
          cracks, therefore ground improvements must take place before construction can start. Furthermore, due to this
          proposal requiring an expansion of the airport boundary the A23 and M23 roads would also need to be moved, all
          before a runway could even be built. <a href="#ref-airports-commission-2014">(The Airports Commission, 2014)</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, this proposal is very high impact and technically complex, along with the significant environmental
          and construction challenges that all question its viability. The scale of change to the existing built
          environment and infrastructure diversions that would need to take place, does not align with the core
          principles of responsible and sustainable engineering practices. Furthermore, assuming there are no delays in
          this process (highly unlikely) the runway wouldn't be fully operational for many years, which doesn't address
          the immediate nature of transportation demand.

          Figure 1 shows the master plan for the first proposal with a new runway constructed to the South. This figure
          visually demonstrates the scale and lack of efficiency of this proposal as the existing northern runway will
          still be left inoperative while unnecessarily constructing a new runway to the south.

      <section id="proposal2">
        <h2>Proposal 2: Realignment of the existing northern runway</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, Gatwick's northern runway is non-operational because of safety regulations for simultaneous parallel
          runway operation. <a href="#ref-guildford-2025">(Guildford Society, 2025)</a> Repositioning the centerline by 12 meters to the north would allow
          for departures from this runway <a href="#ref-thecivilengineer-2025">(TheCivilEngineer.org, 2025)</a>, as seen in Figure 2.
        </p>
        <figure class="figure">
          <img src="proposal2-figure2.png" alt="Diagram illustrating the proposed realignment of the northern runway at Gatwick Airport" />
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">
            Figure 2: Diagram illustrating the proposed realignment of the northern runway at Gatwick Airport.   <a href="#ref-austin-whitehead-2025">(Austin and Whitehead, 2025)</a>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Although this proposal wouldn't increase capacity as significantly as the first design, it would allow for
          100000 more flights per year. <a href="#ref-thecivilengineer-2025">(TheCivilEngineer.org, 2025)</a> Which is still a significant increase given the lower
          impact of the proposal as this design avoids the complexity of land accusation and development. However, the
          existing pavement must be widened and reinforced to meet new runway requirements as the runway will be subject
          to frequent take-off and roll stress. <a href="#ref-guildford-2025">(Guildford Society, 2025)</a> Therefore, the design must account for
          repetitive loading and thermal effects as aircraft will be at maximum weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, one benefit of this proposal is that the new runway does not need to account for the much larger
          impact loads exerted on the pavement during landings therefore the design can be optimized for static rather
          than impact loads. As a result, less material and fewer layers of asphalt can be used when resurfacing the
          runway while also extending the pavement life of the runway.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the use of graphene enhanced asphalt can allow for less material to be used as a pose to the
          currently used marshal asphalt. <a href="#ref-davis-2024">(Davis, 2024)</a> This is simply because incorporating graphene or other
          nanomaterials into the asphalt mixture can significantly boost strength and long-term durability. <a href="#ref-davis-2024">(Davis, 2024)</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, if the existing demolished materials such as crushed concrete can be reused as a subbase for new
          pavements, this would minimise the new materials needed without compromising safety. Environmentally, this will
          result in a significant reduction in embodied emissions (Which are the total greenhouse gas emissions released
          to build something before it is used) when compared to the initial proposal. Furthermore, due to increased
          strength and resilience, the runway will allow for longer intervals between maintenance therefore reducing the
          operational emissions of this design (The emissions released from using the runway). <a href="#ref-davis-2024">(Davis, 2024)</a> Another
          method of reducing emissions during the construction process trailed by Gatwick when resurfacing its current
          operational runway was an onsite asphalt plant to reduce transportation emissions. <a href="#ref-gatwick-2022">(Gatwick Airport Ltd, 2022)</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          During Gatwick's main runway resurfacing by using advanced materials and innovative construction practices the
          project used 70 percent less material than traditional resurfacing only methods. <a href="#ref-gatwick-2022">(Gatwick Airport Ltd, 2022)</a>
          meaning, the northern runways realignment would employ trialed similar techniques to minimise the environmental
          degradation from this proposal.
        </p>
      </section>

      
      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This comparative evaluation shows that while the new southern runway design (proposal 1) offers the highest
          increase in airport capacity, it comes with disproportionate civil engineering risks. The requirement to divert
          the River Mole and stabilise the poorly drained Weald clay introduces significant geotechnical uncertainty.
          These factors, combined with the high embodied carbon associated with the new runway challenge the long term
          sustainability of this design (proposal 1).
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the northern runway realignment design (proposal 2) represents a sustainable engineering solution to
          increase capacity. Because we make use of the existing inoperative runway, this design (proposal 2) avoids the
          challenges and risks of major earthworks and land acquisition. Furthermore, the use of advanced materials such
          as graphene enhanced asphalt and the recycling of demolished concrete for subbase layers significantly reduces
          the proposals embodied carbon footprint making this design even more sustainable solution to expand airport
          capacity.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          This article compares two different design proposals for the expansion of Gatwick airport. The first expansion
          proposal is the construction of a completely new runway to the south of the existing runway. The second
          expansion proposal is the realignment of an existing inoperative runway (which is to the north of the existing
          runway). Ultimately while each expansion proposal will lead to two active runways at Gatwick, they achieve this
          in different ways. This articles evaluation of the engineering challenges and sustainability concerns of each
          geotechnical design found that the proposal that aligns most with civil engineering principles is the second
          proposal (the realignment of an existing inoperative runway).

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Given the growing demand for air transportation, existing airport infrastructure can no longer safely meet the
          needs of both local and global communities. As a result, an expansion of airport infrastructure around London is
          necessary to increase capacity and meet growing demand. Gatwick offers a low impact solution to this issue, due
          to its unique existing infrastructure and location that can support expansion. (Irvine, Budd and Pitfield,
          2015)
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Proposal 1 -->
      <section id="proposal1">
        <h2>Proposal 1: Construction of a new runway to the south</h2>
        <p>
          Although Gatwick is the world's busiest single runway airport (Gatwick Airport Ltd, 2021) (and this design
          would allow for more annual air transport movements than the second design), it introduces many civil
          engineering challenges. For example, due to the large land acquisition needed, the existing ecosystem will be
          significantly disturbed due to the loss of local greenfield sites. (The Airports Commission, 2014) Importantly,
          Gatwick's existing runway is built over the river Mole (The Airports Commission, 2014) which means that a new
          runway beyond the airport boundary would require diverting the river around the new airport perimeter before
          runway construction could start, therefore this proposal isn't just about building a new runway, it’s also
          rebuilding the local environment to make room for the new runway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, this development comes with significant geotechnical challenges due to the nature of the
          existing Weald clay soil which is poorly drained (British Geological Survey, 2023) and may cause water
          retention therefore raising concerns about ground stability which may result in uneven runway surfaces and
          cracks, therefore ground improvements must take place before construction can start. Furthermore, due to this
          proposal requiring an expansion of the airport boundary the A23 and M23 roads would also need to be moved, all
          before a runway could even be built. (The Airports Commission, 2014)
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, this proposal is very high impact and technically complex, along with the significant environmental
          and construction challenges that all question its viability. The scale of change to the existing built
          environment and infrastructure diversions that would need to take place, does not align with the core
          principles of responsible and sustainable engineering practices. Furthermore, assuming there are no delays in
          this process (highly unlikely) the runway wouldn't be fully operational for many years, which doesn't address
          the immediate nature of transportation demand.

          Figure 1 shows the master plan for the first proposal with a new runway constructed to the South. This figure
          visually demonstrates the scale and lack of efficiency of this proposal as the existing northern runway will
          still be left inoperative while unnecessarily constructing a new runway to the south.
